View my personal website and project portfolio.

I'm a recent gradute of the State University of New Jersey, specifically the Rutgers Business School, who is purusing a career as a web developer/programmer.
I also am quite interested in data analytics. I began making this first website of mine while taking a Relational Databases and Web Applications class and continued to
add to / alter my website to showcase my abilities. I hope to run my own business one day from creating a successful website, software system, app, etc.
