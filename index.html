        <p id="mp">Welcome to My Personal Website! Here, you will see an overview of who I am and why I've chosen to pursue a career in data analytics 
            and web design and development. If you click on my profile picture to the left, you will find yourself at my LinkedIn profile. You will also 
            notice a gallery of my projects below. </p>
        <p id="mp"> I am a senior attending Rutgers University, currently looking for jobs involving web design and/or development as well as data analytics.
            My passion for being in a business environment working with team members is what drove me to this school, and my passion for 
            promoting social good is what lead me to business analytics. I'd love to work in an environment where I can not only apply the skills
            I've acquired but also where I can learn new ones. </p>
        <p id="mp"> Whether it be learning to play the guitar, voluntarily jumping out of an airplane, or simply organizing a meeting with my 
            professor, all of which I have accomplished, I enjoy pushing myself out of my comfort zone and testing my abilities.
            That is why I would love to work for a data-driven organization in order to find solutions to difficult problems. A career that tests 
            my abilities to adapt in new situtions and learn from those situations is what I aspire to have.</p>
        <p id="mp" class="bottomp">I've learned quite a bit of HTML 5, Javascript, CSS, and MySQL, as well as some Java, Python, and R. I'm well versed in Microsoft 
            Office, especially Excel, and would love to acquire skills in a data visualization software such as Tableau. I have some
            experience in Adobe Illustrator and Indesign as well. Here, you can browse a portfolio of many of my projects involving those languages and softwares.</p>
